# Mobile-Phone-Inventory-System

Technologies used:

  HTML: for creating the structure and content of the web pages
  CSS: for styling the web pages
  JavaScript: for adding interactivity to the web pages
  PHP: for server-side scripting and interacting with databases
  MySQL: for storing and retrieving data from a database
  
Design choices:

  Logging was rushed because I was running out of given time.
  Same as Logging, CRUD REST API was not implemented.
  
  Log in functionality was made (in my opinion) in a good way but not having Users class really messed the whole system up.
  
  Most of the time was wasted trying to pass object to add/edit forms while being serialized.
  
  At the moment security is below average.
